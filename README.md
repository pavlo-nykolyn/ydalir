A collection of bash scripts that I've written to solve various issues related to Linux machine
either at work or in my free time.

## veiÃ°i

this script removes a set of fields from a .csv file. Currently, the amount of
fields within the source file is not bounded. In order to use it, invoke it as:

> veidi.bash \<source-file\> \<number-of-fields\> \<field-set\> \<separator\> \<target-dir\>

- \<source-file\>      =\> it can a base name, a relative path or an absolute path;
- \<number-of-fields\> =\> indicates the amount of fields contained within a row;
- \<field-set\>        =\> indicates the set of fields that are to be removed. The field index
                           starts from one. Indexes are separated by a single semi-colon. For
                           example, a valid field set is 2;5;8
- \<separator\>        =\> separator between any two fields of the input file. It will be used in the
                           output file, too. Valid separators belong to the set {',', ';'}
- \<target-dir\>       =\> the directory that will contain the output file

**remember to enclose both the field set and the separator within either single or double quotes**

the name of the output file is derived from the input file name. In particular, _new.csv is
appended to the base name (devoid of its extension) of the latter. If the base name contains
multiple dots, only the token preceding the first one will appear in the output file name.

the script needs the execute privilege:

> chmod +x veidi.bash

valid only for the current user

> chmod u+x veidi.bash

## share_pinger

**the source files are placed within the share_pinger directory of this repository**

this script mounts a samba share after its host becomes reachable. This test is implemented through
the ping utility. In particular, every thirty seconds a shell instance will spawn and invoke ping.
This invocation limits the amount of dispatched packets to three and sets the wait time for a response
to four seconds. Once one of this ping invocation results in a successful response by the host, the
script will proceed to perform the mount.

Two files are needed: share\_pinger.sh and check\_ipv4.sh;
the former implements the main logic, while the latter is called by share_pinger.sh to perform a check
on the IPv4 address that identifies the host of the share. I assume that both scripts are placed within
the same directory. Moreover, in order to run it, it is necessary to execute it as root. Usually, I
run this script through an initialization one after system boot so, there is no need to invoke mount
through sudo.

Another feature of the script is the generation of log data within the file _/var/log/share\_pinger.log_.
Needless to say, this feature requires super-user privileges.

### Synopsis

> share_pinger.sh \<ipv4\> \<source\> \<target\> \<secret\> \<option-list\>

- \<ipv4\>         -\> the IPv4 address of the share host;
- \<source\>       -\> the source directory of the share. This should not be an absolute path. The latter will
                       be defined as //\<ipv4\>/\<source\>;
- \<target\>       -\> target directory;
- \<secret\>       -\> path to a file containing information needed for the authentication procedure to the share.
                       See the documentation for the credentials option of the mount.cifs man page. This file
                       shall be manipulated only by the super user;
- \<option-list\>  -\> a comma-separated list of options valid for the share. The credentials one is inserted
                       automatically by the script;

before using it, make sure that both files have the executable bit set:

(current user)

> chmod u+x share\_pinger.sh check\_ipv4.sh

## create_partition

**the source files are placed within the create_partition directory of this repository**

this script creates an ext4 partition on a block device. If no partition table is detected on the storage device,
a GUID partition table will be created and the partition will become its first one.

Two files are needed: create\_partition.sh and analyze\_parted\_line.awk;
I've created the awk script to analyze the machine-readable output of the print command defined by the parted utility.
In particular, I've considered two cases:

- no partition exists: the nominal size of the block device and its physical block size will be extracted;
- one or multiple partitions exist: both the start and the end offset of the partition will be extracted;

how these values are used:

- the nominal size is used to check the partition size provided by the caller. If the latter is greater than the
  former, no new partition will be created. The initial offset of the new partition is adjusted with respect to:
  the alignment offset (if no partition exists on the device) or the end offset of the last partition;
- the physical block size is used to compute the alignment offset (only when no partition exists on the device);
- both the start and the end offset are set to find the position of the last partition;

### Synopsis

> create_partition.sh \<block-device\> \<partition-size\> \<alignment-scaler\>

- \<block-device\> -\> shall be an absolute path;
- \<partition-size\> -\> shall be expressed in bytes (there is no need to append the unit B at the end of the value);
- \<alignment-scaler\> -\> a value belonging to the \[1, 65535\] interval. Used to compute the start offset of the first partition;

if the alignment scaler is not specified, it will be assumed that its value is 65535
there is no need to invoke the script with super user privileges, as all invocation to the parted utility do so.
